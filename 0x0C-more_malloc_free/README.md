Using malloc and free in C
Introduction
This README provides an overview of how to use malloc and free in the C programming language. malloc is used to allocate memory dynamically, and free is used to release allocated memory. These functions are essential for managing memory resources efficiently in C.

malloc Function
The malloc function (memory allocation) is used to dynamically allocate memory in C. It reserves a block of memory with a specified size and returns a pointer to the first byte of the block.

free Function
The free function is used to deallocate the memory previously allocated by malloc. It's crucial to free memory to prevent memory leaks in your program.
