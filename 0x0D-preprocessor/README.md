Introduction
The C Preprocessor (CPP) is like your code's best friend. It helps prepare your C or C++ code for actual compilation by making necessary adjustments. Let's keep it simple.

Why Use the CPP?
Headers: You can include external files to expand your code's capabilities.
Macros: Create shortcuts for code or constants.
Conditional Compilation: Decide which parts of your code to use based on conditions.
Basic Directives

1. #include
It lets you bring in external files. Think of it as adding tools to your toolbox

2. #define
This is your custom abbreviation maker. Define constants or code snippets.

3. Conditional Code
Decide what code to use based on conditions.

Macros
Macros make coding easier:

Object-like Macros: Simple text substitutions.
Function-like Macros: More advanced code replacements.

File Inclusion
Prevent including the same header file multiple times.

Tips
Use include guards to avoid header duplication.
Keep macros straightforward.
Save complex logic for real functions.
Keep your macros and directives organized and documented.
