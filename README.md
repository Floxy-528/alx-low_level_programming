Singly Linked Lists in C
Overview
This project repository contains implementations and solutions related to Singly Linked Lists in the C programming language. The main focus of this project is to understand, implement, and utilize the concepts and operations associated with singly linked lists.

## Project Requirements

- **Editors Allowed**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Compilation Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- **File Ending**: All files should end with a new line.
- **README File**: A `README.md` file is mandatory.
- **Code Style**: Betty style will be enforced using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- **Function Limit**: No more than 5 functions per file.
- **Global Variables**: Not allowed.
- **Standard Library Functions**: Limited to `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. No other standard library functions allowed except `_putchar`.
- **Allowed Functions**: `_putchar` can be used.
- **_putchar.c**: Not required to be pushed, as it won't be considered.
- **Header File**: Prototypes of all functions and `_putchar` should be included in `lists.h`.
- **Include Guards**: All header files should be include guarded.

## File Structure

- `lists.h`: Header file containing function prototypes and `_putchar` declaration.
- `0-add_node.c`: Contains functions to add nodes to the linked list.
- `1-delete_node.c`: Functions to delete nodes from the linked list.
- `2-print_list.c`: Functions to print the linked list.
- `3-main.c`: Example `main.c` file (not required to push).
